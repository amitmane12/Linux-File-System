LVM is a tool for logical volume management which includes allocating disks, striping, mirroring and resizing logical volumes.
With LVM, a hard drive or set of hard drives is allocated to one or more physical volumes.
 LVM physical volumes can be placed on other block devices which might span two or more disks.
The physical volumes are combined into logical volumes, with the exception of the /boot partition.
 The /boot partition cannot be on a logical volume group because the boot loader cannot read it
LVM:
  1. It is logical volume manager.
  2. It is a device mapper framework that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel.
  3. It is used for creating single logical volumes of multiple physical volumes for entire hard disk allowing for dynamic volume resizing.
  4. Most modern Linux distributions are LVM aware to point of being able to have their root file system on a logical volume.
  5. Performing consistent backups by taking snapshots of the logical volume.
