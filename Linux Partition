LINUX PARTITION:-
The process of dividing a disk into logical areas that can be worked with separately is called partitioning. Disk partitioning is done to subdivide the disk into pieces with broadly different purposes. There are several reasons why you want to use partitioning: multiple operating systems on the same disk.
Partitioning allows the use of different filesystems to be installed for different kinds of files. Separating user data from system data can prevent the system partition from becoming full and rendering the system unusable. Partitioning can also make backing up easier.

Steps to create a partition:
             1. list partitions.
             2. label a partition.
             3. Use mkpart to make a partition.
             4. let the partition be created/settle.
             5. Attach the file system to the partition.
             6. Create a Mount point directory.
             7. Add entry in fstab.
             8. Systemctl daemon-reload.
             9. Mount the partition on the directory.
            10. Reboot.

Commands used in this are as follows:
             
             1)list block with UUID Lsblk - fs /dev/vdb
             2)list partitions - parted -l
             3)make label to a partition - parted /dev/vdb mklabel msdos
             4)create a partition - mkpart
             5)wait till partition is registered successfully - udevadm settle
             6)format file system with XFS file system - mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb1
             7)restart daemon service- systemctl daemon-reload
