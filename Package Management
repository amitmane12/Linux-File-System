Package management-
        it is a method of installing, updating, removing, and keeping track of software updates from specific repositories (repos) in the Linux system.

YUM is the primary package management tool for installing, updating, removing, and managing software packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. YUM performs dependency resolution when installing, updating, and removing software packages. YUM can manage packages from installed repositories in the system or from .rpm packages. The main configuration file for YUM is at /etc/yum.conf, and all the repos are at /etc/yum.repos.d.

PACKAGE MANAGEMENT

•	Package in Linux – 
In Linux distributions, a “package” refers to a compressed file archive containing all of the files that come with a particular application. 
The files are usually stored in the package according to their relative installation paths on your system. 
Most packages also contain installation instructions for the OS, as well as a list of any other packages that are dependencies (prerequisites required for installation).


•	How package management systems work –
If a certain package requires a certain resource such as a shared library, or another package, it is said to have a dependency.
All modern package management systems provide some method of dependency resolution to ensure that when a package is installed, all of its dependencies are installed as well.

•	YUM Package manager –
YUM is the primary package management tool for installing, updating, removing, and managing software packages in linux.
YUM can manage packages from installed repositories in the system.

* In linux there are different package managers with different linux distros
for example as we see -we use yum in centos and red hat linux (both based on rpm) and we use apt-get to package mager in ubantu ,mint and others which are debian based.


1. File must exist in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory
2. File must have an extension .repo
3. If GPG check is enabled then GPG key must be mentioned.

Commands for package management –
1. To view the package details: yum info PACKAGENAME 
2. Install a package:  yum install PACKAGENAME 
3. Update all package: yum update
4. Remove a package: yum remove PACKAGENAME
5. To view transaction history: yum remove PACKAGENAME
6. To reverse a transaction: yum history undo INDEXNUMBER

$ yum search {package-name} = To search for packages by name.
$ yum info {pkg-1} {pkg-2} = To see detailed information about a package.
$ yum deplist {pkg} = To show dependencies list for a package.
# yum install {package-name-1} {package-name-2} = To install the specified packages.
